## Solve the problem description in advance

According to the recommendations published by the health department, citizens should consume at least two servings of fruit every day. Insufficient fruit intake may lead to chronic
Diseases and even the top 10 causes of death in the world, show the importance of fruit food. However, there are many apps in the existing market that record the calories of three diets and station control. Currently, the APP ignores the importance of fruits.
A large number of risky scientific studies have shown that developing the habit of eating fruits can effectively reduce chronic diseases such as tumors, because fruits contain many antioxidant ingredients that can delay the aging of cells, and a large amount of vitamins help normalize cells. In addition, fruits have more It can provide the energy needed by the brain. However, most people think that "you do not need to eat fruits to eat vegetables." This concept is wrong because fruits are richer in organic acids and carbohydrates than fresh vegetables, and they are appetizing, antioxidant, and promote absorption. Efficacy, vegetables, and fruits are different in terms of nutritional content, taste, and satiety, so they cannot replace each other in terms of nutritional balance and value. There is no APP focusing on fruit ingredients and nutritional content.
Based on the above, the team wants to develop an APP about fruits and nutritional ingredients to guide users to eat fruits, reduce sugar, and develop long-term habits.

## Idea analysis
According to survey results, up to 86% of people aged 19 to 64 years old consume less than 2 servings of fruit (Ministry of Health and Welfare, National Institutes of Health and Human Services, 2018). Due to economic growth and the tight pace of life in Taiwan, many urbanized people have become more stressed. As a result, as many as 40% of people drink sugary drinks at least 7 times a week to relieve stress, whether they are commercially available drinks or hand drinks. Fructose syrup, which is genetically modified from corn, is often added to it. This syrup is metabolized in the human body directly through
The liver stores fat as fat, which can lead to adverse biochemical reactions such as elevated triglycerides and increased insulin resistance. If drinking sugary drinks becomes a long-term habit, it will lead to a 26% increase in diabetes, a 20% increase in metabolic syndrome, and high uric acid. The disease increases by 85% and causes chronic kidney disease (Health Magazine, 2015). However, it is not easy to quit the habit of hand-cranked drinks. Therefore, our team wants to use homemade fruit tea as the main focus, using more natural and healthy fruit fructose to replace the intake of hand-cranked cups, and gradually improve the Chinese people's addiction to hand-cranked cups.


1. Facial emotion analysis combined with fruit recommendations. Diet not only affects physical health but also affects mental health. Long-term and uncontrolled stress can lead to health problems. Many studies have shown that there is a high correlation between eating fruits and vegetables and stress. Because the important nutrients such as vitamins and minerals in fruits can significantly affect brain activity, imbalanced nutritional intake is one of the common causes of depression. For example, a lack of niacin (vitamin B3) can lead to diarrhea and dermatitis. , low mood, and even dementia, so it is very important to eat the right food and take in correct and balanced nutrition. This system uses facial emotion analysis to analyze the user's past dietary deficiencies and current happiness and anger. , Ai and Le give different dietary recommendations.
2. Machine learning image analysis of fruit maturity and sweetness In order to allow users to quickly grasp the nutritional content of fruits and develop the habit of paying attention to a balanced diet, the system
Import the image recognition function and use the method of photographing fruits to perform image recognition. The purpose of recognition is to identify fruit items to estimate the maturity, sweetness, grams, nutrients, and other main nutritional components of the fruit, and automatically write them into the system. Use The simplified process design can increase users' convenience and willingness to use, and further develop the good habit of reducing sugar.
3. Activity intensity analysis of individual fruit nutrients needed
This system creates personalized daily fruit intake recommendations based on the user's activity intensity. According to the "Daily Dietary Guidelines" issued by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, food is divided into six major categories, namely whole grains, beans, fish, eggs, meat, dairy products, vegetables, fruits, oils, nuts, and seeds. Based on the individual's age, gender, height, weight, and exercise intensity, it calculates the individual's daily caloric needs and sugar intake and finally estimates the user's most appropriate number of fruit servings.
